![alt text](./docs/changelog-reminder.png "Logo Title Text 1")

## Usage

1. Install the app on the intended repositories. The app has **no access to your code**. It requires following permissions:
  - **Read** access to metadata and single file `.github/config.yml`
  - **Read** and **write** access to pull requests
2. Add a `.github/config.yml` file that contains the contents you would like to reply within an `changelogReminderMessage`.

```yml
# Message to be posted when PRs don't update changelog
changelogReminderMessage: >
    Thanks for opening this pull request! All notable changes to this project should be documented in CHANGELOG.md. Please update it based on your changes.

```
